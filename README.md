Title: Stevens’ rule and other biogeographic phenomena across latitudinal and elevational gradients: a case study with tropical epiphytes lends insights to conservation.

Running headline: Biogeography of tropical montane epiphytes

Abstract:
Aim: Characteristics of species’ geographic ranges can help predict climatic sensitivity and risk from climate change, but little is known about the distributions of most tropical species. We characterize the distributions of over 500 epiphyte species to examine gradients in richness and range size across both latitude and elevation, with the aim of informing extinction risks posed by climate change.
Location: Neotropics
Time period: Present
Major taxa studied: Two plant genera: Peperomia and Elaphoglossum
Methods: We compiled 35,382 GBIF records for 505 species, calculated species’ latitudinal and elevational range extents, and examined gradients in richness and range size. For individual species, we analyzed the relationship between elevational and latitudinal occurrences.
Results: We demonstrate a positive relationship across species between latitudinal and elevational extent. Average latitudinal extent of species’ ranges increased at higher latitudes. Average elevational extent increased with elevation in the global dataset, but most subsets of the data demonstrated a peak in average extent size at mid-elevations. Approximately 20% of species demonstrate a significant negative relationship between their latitudinal and elevational occurrences.
Main conclusions: We found a positive linear relationship among species latitudinal and elevational extents, a pattern addressed only sporadically in the literature, but which we expect to be repeated for many other taxonomic groups and which we refer to here as “Stevens’ Rule”. While Rapoport’s rule and its elevational corollary were supported in part, the unexpected occurrence of many species with narrow elevational extents near the equator suggests a possible focus for conservation effort. Likewise, many species have individual distributions that decrease in elevation with increasing latitude, suggesting that these species are more sensitive to climate than would be initially surmised by their broad geographic distributions. Wide-ranging species with this geographic distribution syndrome may be at risk across their ranges from future changes in climate.
